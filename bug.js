This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with a custom `onBarCodeScanned` function.  The barcode scanning works correctly, but the callback function is not always triggered, leading to missed barcode scans. This seems to be intermittent and is not consistent across all devices or Expo versions. The issue might be related to the camera's internal processing or race conditions between the camera's barcode scanning and the callback execution.
